## Summary:

1. In Des Moines, there are 4x more annual subscribers than short-term riders. This indicating a strong bussiness potential with steady revenue. 

2. Among all riders in August, 65% of them identified as male, and only less 25% identified as female. There are might be potential opportunity to increase number of female riders for bussiness growth. 

3. The majority riders checkout time is less than 20 mins. This shows that most riders might need the bike for a short communite between 2 destination rather than long distance commute. 

3. Male riders checkout time is slightly hosrter than female riders. This might due to the speed of a ride or purpose of a use. This need further data points to prove.

4. Bussinest time of bike rides is from Monday to Friday between 5 pm -7 pm. This can potentially explain the short checkout time. The majority of the ride used for after work short coomute between 2 destination points. And similair trends by genders. 

5. Looking at the data by users types. Subcribers mostly active during weekdays to use the bikes for work commute. On the other hands, short-term customers purpose is not for the work commute, hen they are more active during weekends. 

Further analysis suggestions:

- Since the ride share purpose might differ by user types, it's worth to analyze start and end locations for the ride by cutomer types. Are the subcribers peak time locations are around bus/matro stations? and busiest areas of Des Moines working professionals? and How does this different from short-term customers?
Create 2 visulizations to map poppular locations by user type to make a comparisons. 

- Another question to consider is that: how should the bussiness accomodate both types of users during the peak hours? Are short-term customers peak hours/days differ significantly by seasonality?
